Learning to deal with GitHub
Following in the footsteps of my wife, I've decided to learn some programming languages and gain a bit of real-life coding experienvce. Otherwise we will soon have fewer and fewer common topics to discuss at home :) as she loves what she's doing and I like the progress she's making.
